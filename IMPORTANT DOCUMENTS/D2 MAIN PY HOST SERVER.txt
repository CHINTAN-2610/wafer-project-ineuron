1> Here different server has created.
----> from wsgiref import simple_server
----> httpd = simple_server.make_server(host, port, app)

three argument required where simple_server is imported and make_server is 
method used for this.

2> host = '0.0.0.0'    --> local address
3> port = int(os.getenv("PORT",5000))   --> if port not available than take it 5000 as mentioned
4> httpd.serve_forever()
